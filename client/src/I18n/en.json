Then look at the amount of money you can save and ask yourself if it's worth it to try and find out how to contact them. Of course your landlord is also obligated to inform you of the previous rent level but there are no consequences if they don't, so often they won't. Maybe you can get in touch with previous tenant's by asking your neighbors if they have their current address or phone numer. Pro Mietrecht has collected some more tips and ideas on how you can find out about this: {link}.",
